## Introduction

SpaceChunks is an experimental voxel game that I orginally wrote in 2014. The code is quite messsy as I was very new to programming back then, and even newer to c++. I may clean up the code and fix issues when I have free time.

Things I would like to do are:

- Update to a modern rendering engine. Either DirectX 12 or Vulkan.
- Implement a proper physics engine.
- Skybox.
- Raycasting.

Feel free to use any of this code in your own projects, let me know of any awesome things you create using this code [here](https://twitter.com/dominicjmaas)
